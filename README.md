Investigate the "Stroop Effect" data

Stroop Effect Test: In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. When the name of a color (e.g., "blue", "green", or "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word "red" printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect has been used to create a psychological test (Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.

Project Description: In this project, First I establish the Null and Alternate Hypotheses. Then I will look at some data collected from others (stroopdata.csv) who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results.  Finally, I will interpret the results in terms of my hypotheses.

Significance of this project: Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on our observations. Also, using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a Data Analyst's work.
